README

These files are meant as tutorials for an introductory statistics class focused on social scientific applications of statistical concepts.

They were originally accompanied by a lecture which explained the various concepts underlying each technique and are therefore incomplete and meant only as a reference and guide for future users.

HTML versions of the scripts are available at http://joshaclark.com
